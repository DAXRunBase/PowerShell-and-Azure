I am using Notion for document editing. It has a very limited setting for printing to PDF, so I do this instead:

When I am done with a paper for the university, I choose Export to HTML.

After that we can run this tool to print the document using Chrome browser in Windows with custom HTML code injection.
It adds custom margins defined in pixels, and formats the document to be Single Page to avoid page breaks at unintended places.

We can also decide to add or remove the Notion page header.
